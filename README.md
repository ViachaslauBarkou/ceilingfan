# Ceiling Fan
A simple ceiling fan with 2 pull cords to control speed and direction.

## Description
This application models a ceiling fan with the following characteristics:
- **Two pull cords:**
    - **Speed Cord:** Each pull increases the speed by one level. The fan has 3 speed settings and an "off" setting (speed 0). If the cord is pulled while on speed 3, the fan returns to the "off" setting.
    - **Direction Cord:** Each pull reverses the direction of the fan at the current speed. The direction remains reversed as you cycle through the speed settings until reversed again.
- **Power Assumption:** The fan is always powered on (no wall switch).

## Functionality
- **Increase Speed:** The `pullSpeedCord()` method increases the fan's speed or resets it to "off" if it's currently at maximum speed.
- **Reverse Direction:** The `pullDirectionCord()` method reverses the fan's rotation direction while maintaining the current speed.
- **Get Current State:** Methods `getSpeed()` and `isClockwiseDirection()` return the current speed and rotation direction of the fan.

## Requirements
- **Java 11 or higher**
- **Maven 3.6.0 or higher**
